# PROG 5010 - Assignment 2 

##  Interactive Website built with Advanced CSS Tools

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the assignment.  
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

###  Important Note: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the assignment (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the assignment.  

##  Overview

The task is to create a  single-page website for **Acme Creatives**, a digital marketing and web design agency that focuses on helping brands create captivating online experiences. The site design will demonstrate your skills in web design and development, employing either *SASS/SCSS*, the *Bootstrap CSS Framework*, or *Tailwind CSS*, or some combination of these. The objective is to craft a site that should feel modern, innovative, and visually appealing, reflecting the creative nature of the agency, featuring captivating content, images, and an interactive effect built using HTML Canvas.

## General Requirements

**REQ-001 Design Concept**

Students must create a single-page website for the **ACME Creatives** digital marketing and design agency. The site should convey a sense of creativity and innovation, using bold yet professional colors and dynamic visuals that capture the spirit of a cutting-edge digital agency.

**REQ-002 Content and Imagery**

Incorporate lively content and engaging imagery related to an innovative design firm. Utilize placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum) for paragraphs if necessary, but ensure headers are meaningful and descriptive. Have at least some engaging images as well. Include sections for **services**, **portfolio highlights**, and **client testimonials**. Make sure there is a navigation menu at the top of the page permitting the user to navigate down to each of these sections.

**REQ-003 HTML Canvas Effect**

Utilize the HTML canvas tag to create an animated background or interactive design element(s) (such as particles that follow the cursor, a morphing shape animation, or a rotating logo) to enhance the visual appeal of the site and to demonstrate ACME's capabilities. It is okay to follow an **online tutorial** to achieve this effect, but you must clearly cite the tutorial in the code.

## Architecture Requirements

**REQ-004 Advanced CSS Techniques**

You must choose and apply one or more of the following techniques: SASS/SCSS, the Bootstrap CSS Framework, or Tailwind CSS, to structure and style the website.

**REQ-005 Responsive Design**

The site must be fully functional and appear correctly (i.e. no horizontal scrolling) on smaller screens and mobile devices. Bootstrap and/or Tailwind CSS can be used to achieve this. 

## Instructions

**1.**  **Don’t forget that a Code Review demonstration of your code is a necessary part of this assignment. You MUST complete the code explanation/code review part of the video submission checklist to get credit for the assignment. Part of the assessment will include your ability to speak about the code you wrote, even if it doesn’t completely work or do what you expect. You do not need audio or to speak during the rest of the video, but it is required for the code review section as indicated in the checklist.**

**2.** **Late submissions will be subject to the late penalties laid out in the course outline.**

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. VS Code within your GitHub Codespace) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 2 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: UNLIKE WEBD5000 **YOU WILL NEED TO SPEAK** DURING THE VIDEO. THERE IS A CODE REVIEW REQUIREMENT IN THE CHECKLIST THAT INVOLVES YOU EXPLAINING AT LEAST A PART OF YOUR CODE THROROUGHLY AND YOU MUST HAVE AUDIO FOR THAT.
